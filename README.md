FUNDAMENTS OF DATASTRUCTURE IN C LANGUAGE


 # ARRAYS

Arrays are contigious memory locations which contain similar data. The memory addresses of arrays are in sequential order.
The code below displays the declaratrion and the insertion of arrays in a specifically C language format.
```
void main()
{
 int a[10];
 
 for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
 {
 scanf("%d",&a[i]);
 }

} 
```
# Linklist

linklist's are the proper structured containers. They are not contigious memory locations.They are composed of multiple nodes. Each node is structure which can contain multiple data types. It compulsorily must contain a pointer to structure within the node. The pointer helps point to a node which is similar to the node that contains the
